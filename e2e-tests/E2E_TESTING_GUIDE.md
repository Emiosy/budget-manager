# 🎭 E2E Testing Guide - Playwright HTML Reports

This guide explains how to run Playwright E2E tests and generate HTML reports both locally and in CI/CD pipeline.

## 📋 Overview

The project uses Playwright for comprehensive end-to-end testing with multiple reporting formats:
- **HTML Report**: Interactive visual report with test details, screenshots, and traces
- **JUnit XML**: For CI/CD integration and test result parsing
- **JSON**: Structured test results for programmatic processing

## 🖥️ Local Development

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Available Commands

#### Standard Test Execution

```bash
# Run all E2E tests with default reporters (HTML + JUnit + JSON)
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with HTML report only
npm run test:e2e:html

# Run tests for CI (list + HTML reporters)
npm run test:e2e:ci
```

#### Interactive Testing

```bash
# Run tests with Playwright UI (interactive mode)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run tests in headed mode (visible browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Debug tests step by step
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

#### Report Management

```bash
# View the last generated HTML report
npm run test:e2e:report

# This opens the HTML report in your default browser
# Report includes:
# - Test execution timeline
# - Screenshots on failures
# - Network requests
# - Console logs
# - Trace files for detailed debugging
```

### 📊 HTML Report Features

The generated HTML report provides:

#### **Test Overview**
- ✅ Pass/fail status for each test
- ⏱️ Execution time and performance metrics
- 📈 Overall test suite statistics
- 🔄 Retry information and attempts

#### **Detailed Test Information**
- 📸 **Screenshots**: Automatic screenshots on failures
- 🎬 **Video Recording**: Full test execution videos (if enabled)
- 📋 **Step-by-step Actions**: Detailed test step breakdown
- 🌐 **Network Activity**: API calls and responses
- 💬 **Console Logs**: Browser console output

#### **Debugging Tools**
- 🔍 **Trace Viewer**: Interactive trace files for failed tests
- 📱 **Device Emulation**: Test results across different screen sizes
- 🧭 **Navigation Timeline**: Page navigation and load times

### 📁 Report Structure

After running tests, you'll find:

```
playwright-report/
├── index.html              # Main HTML report (open this file)
├── data/                   # Test data and metadata
├── trace/                  # Trace files for debugging
├── screenshots/            # Failure screenshots
├── results.xml             # JUnit XML format
└── results.json            # JSON test results
```

### 🔧 Local Usage Examples

#### Generate HTML Report for Failed Tests Only

```bash
# Run tests and generate report only if there are failures
npm run test:e2e:html -- --reporter=html --on-failure
```

#### Run Specific Test with HTML Report

```bash
# Run only user workflow test with HTML report
npx playwright test user-workflow.spec.js --reporter=html
```

#### Open Last Report

```bash
# View the most recent HTML report
npm run test:e2e:report
```

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI pipeline automatically:

1. **Runs E2E Tests**: Executes all Playwright tests
2. **Generates Reports**: Creates HTML, JUnit, and JSON reports
3. **Uploads Artifacts**: Makes reports available for download
4. **Provides Access**: Reports available for 30 days

### Accessing CI Reports

#### After CI Completion:

1. **Go to GitHub Actions tab** in your repository
2. **Click on the latest workflow run**
3. **Scroll to "Artifacts" section**
4. **Download artifacts**:
   - `playwright-report` - Contains HTML report
   - `playwright-test-results` - Contains XML/JSON results

#### Report Contents:

**`playwright-report` artifact contains:**
- `index.html` - Interactive HTML report
- Complete trace files for debugging
- Screenshots and videos (if any failures)
- Network logs and console output

**`playwright-test-results` artifact contains:**
- `results.xml` - JUnit format for CI integration
- `results.json` - Structured test results
- `test-results/` - Additional test artifacts

### 📈 CI Report Features

The CI-generated HTML report includes:

- **Full Test Coverage**: All E2E tests executed
- **Environment Details**: CI environment specifications
- **Performance Metrics**: Test execution times in CI environment
- **Failure Analysis**: Detailed failure information with traces
- **Reproducible Results**: Exact conditions for reproducing issues

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.js`)

```javascript
reporter: [
  ['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report', open: 'never' }],
  ['junit', { outputFile: 'playwright-report/results.xml' }],
  ['json', { outputFile: 'playwright-report/results.json' }]
],
```

### Key Settings:
- **`outputFolder`**: Directory for HTML report
- **`open: 'never'`**: Prevents auto-opening in CI
- **Multiple formats**: HTML, JUnit XML, JSON for different needs

## 🔍 Debugging Failed Tests

### Using HTML Report for Debugging:

1. **Open HTML Report**: `npm run test:e2e:report`
2. **Click on Failed Test**: View detailed failure information
3. **Review Screenshots**: See exact failure point
4. **Check Console Logs**: Review browser console output
5. **Examine Network**: Analyze API calls and responses
6. **Use Trace Viewer**: Interactive debugging with Playwright trace

### Advanced Debugging:

```bash
# Run single test with debugging
npx playwright test user-workflow.spec.js --debug

# Run with headed browser to watch execution
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Generate trace on all runs (not just retries)
npx playwright test --trace=on
```

## 📝 Best Practices

### For Local Development:
- Use `npm run test:e2e:ui` for interactive test development
- Use `npm run test:e2e:report` to review results
- Keep reports for debugging failed tests

### For CI/CD:
- Always download and review HTML reports for failed builds
- Use JUnit XML for integration with testing dashboards
- Keep artifacts for historical analysis

### For Team Collaboration:
- Share HTML reports for reproducing issues
- Use trace files for detailed debugging sessions
- Document test failures with report links

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "No files found" Error in CI:
- **Cause**: Tests didn't generate reports
- **Solution**: Check test execution logs, ensure tests run completely

#### Missing HTML Report:
- **Cause**: Reporter configuration issue
- **Solution**: Verify `playwright.config.js` reporter settings

#### Report Not Opening:
- **Cause**: Browser security restrictions
- **Solution**: Manually open `playwright-report/index.html`

### Quick Fixes:

```bash
# Regenerate Playwright configuration
npx playwright install

# Clear previous reports
rm -rf playwright-report/ test-results/

# Run tests with verbose output
npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list
```
